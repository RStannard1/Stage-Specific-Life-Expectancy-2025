# Stage-Specific-Life-Expectancy-2025
This repository contains Stata code written for the statistical analysis conducted for "Estimating the impact of cancer diagnosis on life expectancy by stage at diagnosis: population-based estimates for a range of cancer sites in England".
  
The code can be downloaded and run using an example dataset and associated population mortality file.  
The code has been simplified to analyse one cancer site only.  
  
The publication can be viewed [here](https://www.example.com).
